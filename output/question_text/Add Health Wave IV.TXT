[Wave IV Section 14: Social Psychology and Mental Health] We're going to start this section with a couple of exercises that involve remembering. For this, I need to move the computer so you can't see what's on the screen. I am going to read a list of 15 words. Listen carefully. When I am finished, you are to repeat as many of the words as you can remember. It doesn't matter in what order your repeat them. Just try to remember as many as you can. I will say each word only one time, and I cannot repeat any words. Do you have any questions? Are you ready? (The list of 15 words is displayed on the screen at one second intervals. After the last word is displayed the following text appears below the word list for the interviewer: 'Now tell me as many words as you can remember.' The computer counts down 90 seconds during which the respondent recalls the words. If the respondent stops before remembering all the words and the time is not up, the interviewer asks: 'Can you think of any more?' If the respondent says he/she cannot remember more, the interviewer proceeds to the next task even if there is time remaining. After 90 seconds, a pop-up box appears to indicate the time is up. The interviewer reads the text in the pop-up box: 'Good, now let's go on.' The interviewer is instructed to not share the final score or any words missed or added with the respondent in order to maintain reliability of the test.) Did any of the following happen: interruption during memory task?

I want you to tell me as many of the words from that list as you can. You will have up to one minute. I will tell you when your time is up. Are you ready? (The computer counts down 60 seconds during which the respondent recalls the words. If the respondent stops before remembering all the words and the time is not up, the interviewer asks: 'Can you think of any more?' If the respondent says he/she cannot remember more, the interviewer proceeds to the next task even if there is time remaining. After 60 seconds, a pop-up box appears to indicate the time is up. The interviewer reads the text in the pop-up box: 'Good, now let's go on.' The interviewer is instructed to not share the final score or any words missed or added with the respondent in order to maintain reliability of the test.) Did any of the following happen: interruption during memory task?
